# semantic-markup

In this project, I updated the semantics of the .html file of the website.

Most changes I made were changing the "div" tags to more semantically important and relevant tags, such as "body" and "article".

Other changes I have made was updating the CSS file to properly match the new tag names.

I added "alt" descriptions to the images on the website.
